Next up is looking at Database migrations.\r\ncurrently we generate an SQL Table for the entities that inherite IPandaEntity.\r\nWith the tables created we can POST to http://localhost/api/game/ with some json data.\r\nor if we make a GET request to http://localhost/api/game/ we get back what we have posted.\r\nmeaning we skip the controller. well in a way.\r\n\r\n* Better Database migration.\r\n* Basic Rules Engine (Annotation driven behavior)\r\n* Foreign References\r\n* Unit Tests (way down the line on my todo list, but you are welcome to aid in this)\r\n\r\nWhen I say rule engine what that could be:\r\n* Field Requirements, such as Entity Requires all fields (dont accept partial objects)\r\n* Custom or ASP.NET Identity authentication (as an example)\r\n\r\nCustom Attributes could be:\r\n* API Throttle Limit Attribute.\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\nThis might have been an overly ambitious project to start at 2 in the morning. so if you find this to be handy, \r\nplease contribute with pull requests.\r\n",
